# Development Guidelines for Cursor

## Core Philosophy

**TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions. This is not a suggestion or a preference - it is the fundamental practice that enables all other principles in this document.

I follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a strong emphasis on behavior-driven testing and functional programming principles. All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- No `any` types or type assertions
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them

**Preferred Tools:**

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Prefer immutable patterns

## Testing Principles

### Behavior-Driven Testing

- **No "unit tests"** - this term is not helpful. Tests should verify expected behavior, treating implementation as a black box
- Test through the public API exclusively - internals should be invisible to tests
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files
- Tests that examine internal implementation details are wasteful and should be avoided
- **Coverage targets**: 100% coverage should be expected at all times, but these tests must ALWAYS be based on business behaviour, not implementation details
- Tests must document expected business behaviour

### Testing Tools

- **Jest** or **Vitest** for testing frameworks
- **React Testing Library** for React components
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking when needed
- All test code must follow the same TypeScript strict mode rules as production code

### Test Organization

```
src/
  features/
    payment/
      payment-processor.ts
      payment-validator.ts
      payment-processor.test.ts // The validator is an implementation detail. Validation is fully covered, but by testing the expected business behaviour, treating the validation code itself as an implementation detail
```

### Test Data Pattern

Use factory functions with optional overrides for test data:

```typescript
const getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest = (
  overrides?: Partial<PostPaymentsRequestV3>
): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return {
    CardAccountId: "1234567890123456",
    Amount: 100,
    Source: "Web",
    AccountStatus: "Normal",
    LastName: "Doe",
    DateOfBirth: "1980-01-01",
    PayingCardDetails: {
      Cvv: "123",
      Token: "token",
    },
    AddressDetails: getMockAddressDetails(),
    Brand: "Visa",
    ...overrides,
  };
};

const getMockAddressDetails = (
  overrides?: Partial<AddressDetails>
): AddressDetails => {
  return {
    HouseNumber: "123",
    HouseName: "Test House",
    AddressLine1: "Test Address Line 1",
    AddressLine2: "Test Address Line 2",
    City: "Test City",
    ...overrides,
  };
};
```

Key principles:

- Always return complete objects with sensible defaults
- Accept optional `Partial<T>` overrides
- Build incrementally - extract nested object factories as needed
- Compose factories for complex objects
- Consider using a test data builder pattern for very complex objects

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Strict Mode Requirements

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "strictBindCallApply": true,
    "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  }
}
```

- **No `any`** - ever. Use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- **No type assertions** (`as SomeType`) unless absolutely necessary with clear justification
- **No `@ts-ignore`** or `@ts-expect-error` without explicit explanation
- These rules apply to test code as well as production code

### Type Definitions

- **Prefer `type` over `interface`** in all cases
- Use explicit typing where it aids clarity, but leverage inference where appropriate
- Utilize utility types effectively (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Required`, etc.)
- Create domain-specific types (e.g., `UserId`, `PaymentId`) for type safety
- Use Zod or any other [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) compliant schema library to create types, by creating schemas first

```typescript
// Good
type UserId = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol };
type PaymentAmount = number & { readonly brand: unique symbol };

// Avoid
type UserId = string;
type PaymentAmount = number;
```

#### Schema-First Development with Zod

Always define your schemas first, then derive types from them:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Define schemas first - these provide runtime validation
const AddressDetailsSchema = z.object({
  houseNumber: z.string(),
  houseName: z.string().optional(),
  addressLine1: z.string().min(1),
  addressLine2: z.string().optional(),
  city: z.string().min(1),
  postcode: z.string().regex(/^[A-Z]{1,2}\d[A-Z\d]? ?\d[A-Z]{2}$/i),
});

const PayingCardDetailsSchema = z.object({
  cvv: z.string().regex(/^\d{3,4}$/),
  token: z.string().min(1),
});

const PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema = z.object({
  cardAccountId: z.string().length(16),
  amount: z.number().positive(),
  source: z.enum(["Web", "Mobile", "API"]),
  accountStatus: z.enum(["Normal", "Restricted", "Closed"]),
  lastName: z.string().min(1),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  payingCardDetails: PayingCardDetailsSchema,
  addressDetails: AddressDetailsSchema,
  brand: z.enum(["Visa", "Mastercard", "Amex"]),
});

// Derive types from schemas
type AddressDetails = z.infer<typeof AddressDetailsSchema>;
type PayingCardDetails = z.infer<typeof PayingCardDetailsSchema>;
type PostPaymentsRequestV3 = z.infer<typeof PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema>;

// Use schemas at runtime boundaries
export const parsePaymentRequest = (data: unknown): PostPaymentsRequestV3 => {
  return PostPaymentsRequestV3Schema.parse(data);
};

// Example of schema composition for complex domains
const BaseEntitySchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  createdAt: z.date(),
  updatedAt: z.date(),
});

const CustomerSchema = BaseEntitySchema.extend({
  email: z.string().email(),
  tier: z.enum(["standard", "premium", "enterprise"]),
  creditLimit: z.number().positive(),
});

type Customer = z.infer<typeof CustomerSchema>;
```

#### Schema Usage in Tests

**CRITICAL**: Tests must use real schemas and types from the main project, not redefine their own.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Defining schemas in test files
const ProjectSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  workspaceId: z.string(),
  ownerId: z.string().nullable(),
  name: z.string(),
  createdAt: z.coerce.date(),
  updatedAt: z.coerce.date(),
});

// ✅ CORRECT - Import schemas from the shared schema package
import { ProjectSchema, type Project } from "@your-org/schemas";
```

**Why this matters:**

- **Type Safety**: Ensures tests use the same types as production code
- **Consistency**: Changes to schemas automatically propagate to tests
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for data structures
- **Prevents Drift**: Tests can't accidentally diverge from real schemas

**Implementation:**

- All domain schemas should be exported from a shared schema package or module
- Test files should import schemas from the shared location
- If a schema isn't exported yet, add it to the exports rather than duplicating it
- Mock data factories should use the real types derived from real schemas

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Test factories using real schemas
import { ProjectSchema, type Project } from "@your-org/schemas";

const getMockProject = (overrides?: Partial<Project>): Project => {
  const baseProject = {
    id: "proj_123",
    workspaceId: "ws_456",
    ownerId: "user_789",
    name: "Test Project",
    createdAt: new Date(),
    updatedAt: new Date(),
  };

  const projectData = { ...baseProject, ...overrides };

  // Validate against real schema to catch type mismatches
  return ProjectSchema.parse(projectData);
};
```

## Code Style

### Functional Programming

I follow a "functional light" approach:

- **No data mutation** - work with immutable data structures
- **Pure functions** wherever possible
- **Composition** as the primary mechanism for code reuse
- Avoid heavy FP abstractions (no need for complex monads or pipe/compose patterns) unless there is a clear advantage to using them
- Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over imperative loops

#### Examples of Functional Patterns

```typescript
// Good - Pure function with immutable updates
const applyDiscount = (order: Order, discountPercent: number): Order => {
  return {
    ...order,
    items: order.items.map((item) => ({
      ...item,
      price: item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100),
    })),
    totalPrice: order.items.reduce(
      (sum, item) => sum + item.price * (1 - discountPercent / 100),
      0
    ),
  };
};

// Good - Composition over complex logic
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  return pipe(
    order,
    validateOrder,
    applyPromotions,
    calculateTax,
    assignWarehouse
  );
};

// When heavy FP abstractions ARE appropriate:
// - Complex async flows that benefit from Task/IO types
// - Error handling chains that benefit from Result/Either types
// Example with Result type for complex error handling:
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

const chainPaymentOperations = (
  payment: Payment
): Result<Receipt, PaymentError> => {
  return pipe(
    validatePayment(payment),
    chain(authorizePayment),
    chain(capturePayment),
    map(generateReceipt)
  );
};
```

### Code Structure

- **No nested if/else statements** - use early returns, guard clauses, or composition
- **Avoid deep nesting** in general (max 2 levels)
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer flat, readable code over clever abstractions

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: `camelCase`, verb-based (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `validatePayment`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PaymentRequest`, `UserProfile`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for true constants, `camelCase` for configuration
- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts` for all TypeScript files
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

### No Comments in Code

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. Comments indicate that the code itself is not clear enough.

```typescript
// Avoid: Comments explaining what the code does
const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  // Check if customer is premium
  if (customer.tier === "premium") {
    // Apply 20% discount for premium customers
    return price * 0.8;
  }
  // Regular customers get 10% discount
  return price * 0.9;
};

// Good: Self-documenting code with clear names
const PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.8;
const STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER = 0.9;

const isPremiumCustomer = (customer: Customer): boolean => {
  return customer.tier === "premium";
};

const calculateDiscount = (price: number, customer: Customer): number => {
  const discountMultiplier = isPremiumCustomer(customer)
    ? PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER
    : STANDARD_DISCOUNT_MULTIPLIER;

  return price * discountMultiplier;
};

// Avoid: Complex logic with comments
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // First validate the payment
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid payment");
  }

  // Check if we need to apply 3D secure
  if (payment.amount > 100 && payment.card.type === "credit") {
    // Apply 3D secure for credit cards over £100
    const securePayment = apply3DSecure(payment);
    // Process the secure payment
    return executePayment(securePayment);
  }

  // Process the payment
  return executePayment(payment);
};

// Good: Extract to well-named functions
const requires3DSecure = (payment: Payment): boolean => {
  const SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD = 100;
  return (
    payment.amount > SECURE_PAYMENT_THRESHOLD && payment.card.type === "credit"
  );
};

const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!validatePayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentValidationError("Invalid payment");
  }

  const securedPayment = requires3DSecure(payment)
    ? apply3DSecure(payment)
    : payment;

  return executePayment(securedPayment);
};
```

**Exception**: JSDoc comments for public APIs are acceptable when generating documentation, but the code should still be self-explanatory without them.

### Prefer Options Objects

Use options objects for function parameters as the default pattern. Only use positional parameters when there's a clear, compelling reason (e.g., single-parameter pure functions, well-established conventions like `map(item => item.value)`).

```typescript
// Avoid: Multiple positional parameters
const createPayment = (
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  cardId: string,
  customerId: string,
  description?: string,
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>,
  idempotencyKey?: string
): Payment => {
  // implementation
};

// Calling it is unclear
const payment = createPayment(
  100,
  "GBP",
  "card_123",
  "cust_456",
  undefined,
  { orderId: "order_789" },
  "key_123"
);

// Good: Options object with clear property names
type CreatePaymentOptions = {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  cardId: string;
  customerId: string;
  description?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  idempotencyKey?: string;
};

const createPayment = (options: CreatePaymentOptions): Payment => {
  const {
    amount,
    currency,
    cardId,
    customerId,
    description,
    metadata,
    idempotencyKey,
  } = options;

  // implementation
};

// Clear and readable at call site
const payment = createPayment({
  amount: 100,
  currency: "GBP",
  cardId: "card_123",
  customerId: "cust_456",
  metadata: { orderId: "order_789" },
  idempotencyKey: "key_123",
});

// Avoid: Boolean flags as parameters
const fetchCustomers = (
  includeInactive: boolean,
  includePending: boolean,
  includeDeleted: boolean,
  sortByDate: boolean
): Customer[] => {
  // implementation
};

// Confusing at call site
const customers = fetchCustomers(true, false, false, true);

// Good: Options object with clear intent
type FetchCustomersOptions = {
  includeInactive?: boolean;
  includePending?: boolean;
  includeDeleted?: boolean;
  sortBy?: "date" | "name" | "value";
};

const fetchCustomers = (options: FetchCustomersOptions = {}): Customer[] => {
  const {
    includeInactive = false,
    includePending = false,
    includeDeleted = false,
    sortBy = "name",
  } = options;

  // implementation
};

// Self-documenting at call site
const customers = fetchCustomers({
  includeInactive: true,
  sortBy: "date",
});

// Good: Configuration objects for complex operations
type ProcessOrderOptions = {
  order: Order;
  shipping: {
    method: "standard" | "express" | "overnight";
    address: Address;
  };
  payment: {
    method: PaymentMethod;
    saveForFuture?: boolean;
  };
  promotions?: {
    codes?: string[];
    autoApply?: boolean;
  };
};

const processOrder = (options: ProcessOrderOptions): ProcessedOrder => {
  const { order, shipping, payment, promotions = {} } = options;

  // Clear access to nested options
  const orderWithPromotions = promotions.autoApply
    ? applyAvailablePromotions(order)
    : order;

  return executeOrder({
    ...orderWithPromotions,
    shippingMethod: shipping.method,
    paymentMethod: payment.method,
  });
};

// Acceptable: Single parameter for simple transforms
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name;

// Acceptable: Well-established patterns
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
const users = fetchUsers();
const names = users.map((user) => user.name);
```

**Guidelines for options objects:**

- Default to options objects unless there's a specific reason not to
- Always use for functions with optional parameters
- Destructure options at the start of the function for clarity
- Provide sensible defaults using destructuring
- Keep related options grouped (e.g., all shipping options together)
- Consider breaking very large options objects into nested groups

**When positional parameters are acceptable:**

- Single-parameter pure functions
- Well-established functional patterns (map, filter, reduce callbacks)
- Mathematical operations where order is conventional

## Development Workflow

### TDD Process - THE FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICE

**CRITICAL**: TDD is not optional. Every feature, every bug fix, every change MUST follow this process:

Follow Red-Green-Refactor strictly:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the desired behavior. NO PRODUCTION CODE until you have a failing test.
2. **Green**: Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass. Resist the urge to write more than needed.
3. **Refactor**: Assess the code for improvement opportunities. If refactoring would add value, clean up the code while keeping tests green. If the code is already clean and expressive, move on.

**Common TDD Violations to Avoid:**

- Writing production code without a failing test first
- Writing multiple tests before making the first one pass
- Writing more production code than needed to pass the current test
- Skipping the refactor assessment step when code could be improved
- Adding functionality "while you're there" without a test driving it

**Remember**: If you're typing production code and there isn't a failing test demanding that code, you're not doing TDD.

#### TDD Example Workflow

```typescript
// Step 1: Red - Start with the simplest behavior
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("should calculate total with shipping cost", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 30, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.total).toBe(35.99);
    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(5.99);
  });
});

// Step 2: Green - Minimal implementation
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost: order.shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + order.shippingCost,
  };
};

// Step 3: Red - Add test for free shipping behavior
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("should calculate total with shipping cost", () => {
    // ... existing test
  });

  it("should apply free shipping for orders over £50", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 60, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(0);
    expect(processed.total).toBe(60);
  });
});

// Step 4: Green - NOW we can add the conditional because both paths are tested
const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );

  const shippingCost = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : order.shippingCost;

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + shippingCost,
  };
};

// Step 5: Add edge case tests to ensure 100% behavior coverage
describe("Order processing", () => {
  // ... existing tests

  it("should charge shipping for orders exactly at £50", () => {
    const order = createOrder({
      items: [{ price: 50, quantity: 1 }],
      shippingCost: 5.99,
    });

    const processed = processOrder(order);

    expect(processed.shippingCost).toBe(5.99);
    expect(processed.total).toBe(55.99);
  });
});

// Step 6: Refactor - Extract constants and improve readability
const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;

const calculateItemsTotal = (items: OrderItem[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
};

const qualifiesForFreeShipping = (itemsTotal: number): boolean => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD;
};

const processOrder = (order: Order): ProcessedOrder => {
  const itemsTotal = calculateItemsTotal(order.items);
  const shippingCost = qualifiesForFreeShipping(itemsTotal)
    ? 0
    : order.shippingCost;

  return {
    ...order,
    shippingCost,
    total: itemsTotal + shippingCost,
  };
};
```

### Refactoring - The Critical Third Step

Evaluating refactoring opportunities is not optional - it's the third step in the TDD cycle. After achieving a green state and committing your work, you MUST assess whether the code can be improved. However, only refactor if there's clear value - if the code is already clean and expresses intent well, move on to the next test.

#### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring means changing the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. The public API remains unchanged, all tests continue to pass, but the code becomes cleaner, more maintainable, or more efficient. Remember: only refactor when it genuinely improves the code - not all code needs refactoring.

#### When to Refactor

- **Always assess after green**: Once tests pass, before moving to the next test, evaluate if refactoring would add value
- **When you see duplication**: But understand what duplication really means (see DRY below)
- **When names could be clearer**: Variable names, function names, or type names that don't clearly express intent
- **When structure could be simpler**: Complex conditional logic, deeply nested code, or long functions
- **When patterns emerge**: After implementing several similar features, useful abstractions may become apparent

**Remember**: Not all code needs refactoring. If the code is already clean, expressive, and well-structured, commit and move on. Refactoring should improve the code - don't change things just for the sake of change.

#### Refactoring Guidelines

##### 1. Commit Before Refactoring

Always commit your working code before starting any refactoring. This gives you a safe point to return to:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add payment validation"
# Now safe to refactor
```

##### 2. Look for Useful Abstractions Based on Semantic Meaning

Create abstractions only when code shares the same semantic meaning and purpose. Don't abstract based on structural similarity alone - **duplicate code is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction**.

```typescript
// Similar structure, DIFFERENT semantic meaning - DO NOT ABSTRACT
const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

const validateTransferAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

// These might have the same structure today, but they represent different
// business concepts that will likely evolve independently.
// Payment limits might change based on fraud rules.
// Transfer limits might change based on account type.
// Abstracting them couples unrelated business rules.

// Similar structure, SAME semantic meaning - SAFE TO ABSTRACT
const formatUserDisplayName = (firstName: string, lastName: string): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatCustomerDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatEmployeeDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

// These all represent the same concept: "how we format a person's name for display"
// They share semantic meaning, not just structure
const formatPersonDisplayName = (
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string
): string => {
  return `${firstName} ${lastName}`.trim();
};

// Replace all call sites throughout the codebase:
// Before:
// const userLabel = formatUserDisplayName(user.firstName, user.lastName);
// const customerName = formatCustomerDisplayName(customer.firstName, customer.lastName);
// const employeeTag = formatEmployeeDisplayName(employee.firstName, employee.lastName);

// After:
// const userLabel = formatPersonDisplayName(user.firstName, user.lastName);
// const customerName = formatPersonDisplayName(customer.firstName, customer.lastName);
// const employeeTag = formatPersonDisplayName(employee.firstName, employee.lastName);

// Then remove the original functions as they're no longer needed
```

**Questions to ask before abstracting:**

- Do these code blocks represent the same concept or different concepts that happen to look similar?
- If the business rules for one change, should the others change too?
- Would a developer reading this abstraction understand why these things are grouped together?
- Am I abstracting based on what the code IS (structure) or what it MEANS (semantics)?

**Remember**: It's much easier to create an abstraction later when the semantic relationship becomes clear than to undo a bad abstraction that couples unrelated concepts.

##### 3. Understanding DRY - It's About Knowledge, Not Code

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is about not duplicating **knowledge** in the system, not about eliminating all code that looks similar.

```typescript
// This is NOT a DRY violation - different knowledge despite similar code
const validateUserAge = (age: number): boolean => {
  return age >= 18 && age <= 100;
};

const validateProductRating = (rating: number): boolean => {
  return rating >= 1 && rating <= 5;
};

const validateYearsOfExperience = (years: number): boolean => {
  return years >= 0 && years <= 50;
};

// These functions have similar structure (checking numeric ranges), but they
// represent completely different business rules:
// - User age has legal requirements (18+) and practical limits (100)
// - Product ratings follow a 1-5 star system
// - Years of experience starts at 0 with a reasonable upper bound
// Abstracting them would couple unrelated business concepts and make future
// changes harder. What if ratings change to 1-10? What if legal age changes?

// Another example of code that looks similar but represents different knowledge:
const formatUserDisplayName = (user: User): string => {
  return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`.trim();
};

const formatAddressLine = (address: Address): string => {
  return `${address.street} ${address.number}`.trim();
};

const formatCreditCardLabel = (card: CreditCard): string => {
  return `${card.type} ${card.lastFourDigits}`.trim();
};

// Despite the pattern "combine two strings with space and trim", these represent
// different domain concepts with different future evolution paths

// This IS a DRY violation - same knowledge in multiple places
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    const shippingCost = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Knowledge duplicated!
    return itemsTotal + shippingCost;
  }
}

class OrderSummary {
  getShippingCost(itemsTotal: number): number {
    return itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : 5.99; // Same knowledge!
  }
}

class ShippingCalculator {
  calculate(orderAmount: number): number {
    if (orderAmount > 50) return 0; // Same knowledge again!
    return 5.99;
  }
}

// Refactored - knowledge in one place
const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;
const STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST = 5.99;

const calculateShippingCost = (itemsTotal: number): number => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD ? 0 : STANDARD_SHIPPING_COST;
};

// Now all classes use the single source of truth
class Order {
  calculateTotal(): number {
    const itemsTotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
    return itemsTotal + calculateShippingCost(itemsTotal);
  }
}
```

##### 4. Maintain External APIs During Refactoring

Refactoring must never break existing consumers of your code:

```typescript
// Original implementation
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  // Complex logic all in one function
  if (payment.amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid amount");
  }

  if (payment.amount > 10000) {
    throw new Error("Amount too large");
  }

  // ... 50 more lines of validation and processing

  return result;
};

// Refactored - external API unchanged, internals improved
export const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  validatePaymentAmount(payment.amount);
  validatePaymentMethod(payment.method);

  const authorizedPayment = authorizePayment(payment);
  const capturedPayment = capturePayment(authorizedPayment);

  return generateReceipt(capturedPayment);
};

// New internal functions - not exported
const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): void => {
  if (amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid amount");
  }

  if (amount > 10000) {
    throw new Error("Amount too large");
  }
};

// Tests continue to pass without modification because external API unchanged
```

##### 5. Verify and Commit After Refactoring

**CRITICAL**: After every refactoring:

1. Run all tests - they must pass without modification
2. Run static analysis (linting, type checking) - must pass
3. Commit the refactoring separately from feature changes

```bash
# After refactoring
npm test          # All tests must pass
npm run lint      # All linting must pass
npm run typecheck # TypeScript must be happy

# Only then commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: extract payment validation helpers"
```

#### Refactoring Checklist

Before considering refactoring complete, verify:

- [ ] The refactoring actually improves the code (if not, don't refactor)
- [ ] All tests still pass without modification
- [ ] All static analysis tools pass (linting, type checking)
- [ ] No new public APIs were added (only internal ones)
- [ ] Code is more readable than before
- [ ] Any duplication removed was duplication of knowledge, not just code
- [ ] No speculative abstractions were created
- [ ] The refactoring is committed separately from feature changes

#### Example Refactoring Session

```typescript
// After getting tests green with minimal implementation:
describe("Order processing", () => {
  it("calculates total with items and shipping", () => {
    const order = { items: [{ price: 30 }, { price: 20 }], shipping: 5 };
    expect(calculateOrderTotal(order)).toBe(55);
  });

  it("applies free shipping over £50", () => {
    const order = { items: [{ price: 30 }, { price: 25 }], shipping: 5 };
    expect(calculateOrderTotal(order)).toBe(55);
  });
});

// Green implementation (minimal):
const calculateOrderTotal = (order: Order): number => {
  const itemsTotal = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
  const shipping = itemsTotal > 50 ? 0 : order.shipping;
  return itemsTotal + shipping;
};

// Commit the working version
// git commit -m "feat: implement order total calculation with free shipping"

// Assess refactoring opportunities:
// - The variable names could be clearer
// - The free shipping threshold is a magic number
// - The calculation logic could be extracted for clarity
// These improvements would add value, so proceed with refactoring:

const FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 50;

const calculateItemsTotal = (items: OrderItem[]): number => {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
};

const calculateShipping = (
  baseShipping: number,
  itemsTotal: number
): number => {
  return itemsTotal > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD ? 0 : baseShipping;
};

const calculateOrderTotal = (order: Order): number => {
  const itemsTotal = calculateItemsTotal(order.items);
  const shipping = calculateShipping(order.shipping, itemsTotal);
  return itemsTotal + shipping;
};

// Run tests - they still pass!
// Run linting - all clean!
// Run type checking - no errors!

// Now commit the refactoring
// git commit -m "refactor: extract order total calculation helpers"
```

##### Example: When NOT to Refactor

```typescript
// After getting this test green:
describe("Discount calculation", () => {
  it("should apply 10% discount", () => {
    const originalPrice = 100;
    const discountedPrice = applyDiscount(originalPrice, 0.1);
    expect(discountedPrice).toBe(90);
  });
});

// Green implementation:
const applyDiscount = (price: number, discountRate: number): number => {
  return price * (1 - discountRate);
};

// Assess refactoring opportunities:
// - Code is already simple and clear
// - Function name clearly expresses intent
// - Implementation is a straightforward calculation
// - No magic numbers or unclear logic
// Conclusion: No refactoring needed. This is fine as-is.

// Commit and move to the next test
// git commit -m "feat: add discount calculation"
```

### Commit Guidelines

- Each commit should represent a complete, working change
- Use conventional commits format:
  ```
  feat: add payment validation
  fix: correct date formatting in payment processor
  refactor: extract payment validation logic
  test: add edge cases for payment validation
  ```
- Include test changes with feature changes in the same commit

### Pull Request Standards

- Every PR must have all tests passing
- All linting and quality checks must pass
- Work in small increments that maintain a working state
- PRs should be focused on a single feature or fix
- Include description of the behavior change, not implementation details

## Working with Cursor

### Expectations

When working with my code:

1. **ALWAYS FOLLOW TDD** - No production code without a failing test. This is not negotiable.
2. **Think deeply** before making any edits
3. **Understand the full context** of the code and requirements
4. **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous
5. **Think from first principles** - don't make assumptions
6. **Assess refactoring after every green** - Look for opportunities to improve code structure, but only refactor if it adds value
7. **Keep project docs current** - update them whenever you introduce meaningful changes
   **At the end of every change, update AGENTS.md with anything useful you wished you'd known at the start**.
   This is CRITICAL - Cursor should capture learnings, gotchas, patterns discovered, or any context that would have made the task easier if known upfront. This continuous documentation ensures future work benefits from accumulated knowledge

### Code Changes

When suggesting or making changes:

- **Start with a failing test** - always. No exceptions.
- After making tests pass, always assess refactoring opportunities (but only refactor if it adds value)
- After refactoring, verify all tests and static analysis pass, then commit
- Respect the existing patterns and conventions
- Maintain test coverage for all behavior changes
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Ensure all TypeScript strict mode requirements are met
- Provide rationale for significant design decisions

**If you find yourself writing production code without a failing test, STOP immediately and write the test first.**

### Communication

- Be explicit about trade-offs in different approaches
- Explain the reasoning behind significant design decisions
- Flag any deviations from these guidelines with justification
- Suggest improvements that align with these principles
- When unsure, ask for clarification rather than assuming

## Example Patterns

### Error Handling

Use Result types or early returns:

```typescript
// Good - Result type pattern
type Result<T, E = Error> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E };

const processPayment = (
  payment: Payment
): Result<ProcessedPayment, PaymentError> => {
  if (!isValidPayment(payment)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Invalid payment") };
  }

  if (!hasSufficientFunds(payment)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Insufficient funds") };
  }

  return { success: true, data: executePayment(payment) };
};

// Also good - early returns with exceptions
const processPayment = (payment: Payment): ProcessedPayment => {
  if (!isValidPayment(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentError("Invalid payment");
  }

  if (!hasSufficientFunds(payment)) {
    throw new PaymentError("Insufficient funds");
  }

  return executePayment(payment);
};
```

### Testing Behavior

```typescript
// Good - tests behavior through public API
describe("PaymentProcessor", () => {
  it("should decline payment when insufficient funds", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({ Amount: 1000 });
    const account = getMockAccount({ Balance: 500 });

    const result = processPayment(payment, account);

    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error.message).toBe("Insufficient funds");
  });

  it("should process valid payment successfully", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({ Amount: 100 });
    const account = getMockAccount({ Balance: 500 });

    const result = processPayment(payment, account);

    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.data.remainingBalance).toBe(400);
  });
});

// Avoid - testing implementation details
describe("PaymentProcessor", () => {
  it("should call checkBalance method", () => {
    // This tests implementation, not behavior
  });
});
```

#### Achieving 100% Coverage Through Business Behavior

Example showing how validation code gets 100% coverage without testing it directly:

```typescript
// payment-validator.ts (implementation detail)
export const validatePaymentAmount = (amount: number): boolean => {
  return amount > 0 && amount <= 10000;
};

export const validateCardDetails = (card: PayingCardDetails): boolean => {
  return /^\d{3,4}$/.test(card.cvv) && card.token.length > 0;
};

// payment-processor.ts (public API)
export const processPayment = (
  request: PaymentRequest
): Result<Payment, PaymentError> => {
  // Validation is used internally but not exposed
  if (!validatePaymentAmount(request.amount)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Invalid amount") };
  }

  if (!validateCardDetails(request.payingCardDetails)) {
    return { success: false, error: new PaymentError("Invalid card details") };
  }

  // Process payment...
  return { success: true, data: executedPayment };
};

// payment-processor.test.ts
describe("Payment processing", () => {
  // These tests achieve 100% coverage of validation code
  // without directly testing the validator functions

  it("should reject payments with negative amounts", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({ amount: -100 });
    const result = processPayment(payment);

    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error.message).toBe("Invalid amount");
  });

  it("should reject payments exceeding maximum amount", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({ amount: 10001 });
    const result = processPayment(payment);

    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error.message).toBe("Invalid amount");
  });

  it("should reject payments with invalid CVV format", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({
      payingCardDetails: { cvv: "12", token: "valid-token" },
    });
    const result = processPayment(payment);

    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error.message).toBe("Invalid card details");
  });

  it("should process valid payments successfully", () => {
    const payment = getMockPaymentPostPaymentRequest({
      amount: 100,
      payingCardDetails: { cvv: "123", token: "valid-token" },
    });
    const result = processPayment(payment);

    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.data.status).toBe("completed");
  });
});
```

### React Component Testing

```typescript
// Good - testing user-visible behavior
describe("PaymentForm", () => {
  it("should show error when submitting invalid amount", async () => {
    render(<PaymentForm />);

    const amountInput = screen.getByLabelText("Amount");
    const submitButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit Payment" });

    await userEvent.type(amountInput, "-100");
    await userEvent.click(submitButton);

    expect(screen.getByText("Amount must be positive")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Common Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-patterns

```typescript
// Avoid: Mutation
const addItem = (items: Item[], newItem: Item) => {
  items.push(newItem); // Mutates array
  return items;
};

// Prefer: Immutable update
const addItem = (items: Item[], newItem: Item): Item[] => {
  return [...items, newItem];
};

// Avoid: Nested conditionals
if (user) {
  if (user.isActive) {
    if (user.hasPermission) {
      // do something
    }
  }
}

// Prefer: Early returns
if (!user || !user.isActive || !user.hasPermission) {
  return;
}
// do something

// Avoid: Large functions
const processOrder = (order: Order) => {
  // 100+ lines of code
};

// Prefer: Composed small functions
const processOrder = (order: Order) => {
  const validatedOrder = validateOrder(order);
  const pricedOrder = calculatePricing(validatedOrder);
  const finalOrder = applyDiscounts(pricedOrder);
  return submitOrder(finalOrder);
};
```

## Summary

The key is to write clean, testable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. Every change should be driven by a test that describes the desired behavior, and the implementation should be the simplest thing that makes that test pass. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.

## Recent Learnings

### Auth0 Integration with NestJS
- **Auth0 Management Client**: Use `auth0` package for Management API calls, mock in tests for reliability
- **JWT Token Generation**: Use `@nestjs/jwt` with proper configuration for token signing
- **Environment Variables**: Create separate config files for Auth0 settings with proper fallbacks
- **Test Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (Auth0, JWT) in tests to ensure deterministic behavior

### Database Integration with TypeORM
- **Entity Design**: Create entities that match shared types but with database-specific decorators
- **Repository Pattern**: Implement repositories to abstract database operations and provide clean API
- **Type Mapping**: Use mapping functions to convert between database entities and shared types
- **Test Strategy**: Mock repositories in tests rather than using real database connections

### TDD with External Dependencies
- **Mock External Services**: Always mock external APIs (Auth0, database) in tests
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the service does, not how it does it
- **Incremental Implementation**: Start with mocks, then gradually implement real functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Use NestJS DI to make services easily testable

### Node.js Version Compatibility
- **Vite and Node 22.16+**: Vite 7+ requires Node.js 22.16+ due to `crypto.hash` usage
- **NODE_OPTIONS**: Use `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"` to ensure compatibility
- **Environment Configuration**: Set proper Node version in `.nvmrc` and `package.json` engines field
- **NX Daemon Issues**: When switching Node versions, always run `nx reset` to clear the daemon cache and restart with the correct Node version
- **Dependency Conflicts**: NestJS 11 requires compatible versions of all @nestjs packages - update @nestjs/jwt, @nestjs/passport, and @nestjs/typeorm to version 11 when upgrading
- **Build Requirements**: Frontend builds require Node.js 22.16+ - always switch to Node 22 before building frontend

### Username Authentication Feature Implementation
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented username field using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **Database Schema**: Added unique `username` column to `UserEntity` with proper validation constraints
- **API Validation**: Username validation includes length (3-20 chars), format (alphanumeric + underscore), and uniqueness checks
- **Frontend Forms**: Updated both login and signup forms to support username field with proper validation and error handling
- **Login Flexibility**: Login form accepts either email or username, with smart validation based on input format (@ symbol detection)
- **Translation Keys**: Added comprehensive i18n support for username field and all related error messages in both Spanish and English
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 100% test coverage through behavior-driven testing - all validation logic covered by testing user-facing behavior
- **Auth0 Integration**: Username is stored in local database only, Auth0 still uses email for authentication
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for username conflicts, invalid formats, and validation failures

### Logout Functionality Implementation
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented logout button using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **Profile Page Enhancement**: Added logout button to profile page with user information display (username and email)
- **Session Management**: Logout clears localStorage user data and redirects to home page
- **Conditional Rendering**: Profile page only renders when user is logged in, returns null when not logged in
- **Translation Support**: Added logout translations in both Spanish ("Salir") and English ("Logout")
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage including button rendering, click behavior, and conditional display
- **UI Components**: Used existing Button component with outline variant for consistent styling
- **Navigation Integration**: Proper integration with React Router for redirection after logout

### Login Functionality Implementation
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented login functionality using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **Service Layer**: Created `loginService` to handle API calls with proper error handling for network errors and server responses
- **Form Integration**: Updated `LoginPage` component to integrate with `loginService` and `useAuth` context
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error display for login failures, network errors, and validation errors
- **Session Management**: Successful login calls `login` from `useAuth` context and redirects to `/practice`
- **Mock Management**: Fixed Vitest mock hoisting issues by using `vi.mocked()` instead of direct mock references
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage including successful login, login failure, network errors, and form validation
- **API Integration**: Proper integration with backend `/api/auth/login` endpoint using `LoginRequest` and `AuthResponse` types

### Critical Security Fix - Auth0 Authentication Implementation
- **Security Issue Identified**: Original login implementation accepted ANY password as long as user existed in database
- **Auth0 Integration**: Implemented proper Auth0 Authentication API integration for login validation
- **Password Validation**: Now validates credentials against Auth0 before allowing login
- **Authentication Flow**: Uses Auth0's OAuth token endpoint with password grant type for secure authentication
- **User Lookup**: After Auth0 authentication, looks up user in local database by Auth0 ID
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for Auth0 authentication failures and database lookup failures
- **Test Updates**: Updated all login tests to mock Auth0 authentication responses
- **Security**: Login now properly rejects invalid credentials instead of accepting any password

### User-Friendly Error Messages and i18n Integration
- **Backend Error Messages**: Updated Auth0 error handling to return specific, user-friendly error messages
- **Error Mapping**: Created mapping function to convert backend error messages to i18n keys
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated login service to use i18n keys instead of hardcoded error messages
- **Translation Support**: Added comprehensive error message translations in both Spanish and English
- **Test Coverage**: Updated all tests to expect translated error messages using i18n keys
- **ConfigService Integration**: Added ConfigService to AuthService for Auth0 configuration management
- **Test Module Updates**: Updated test modules to include ConfigService mock for proper dependency injection

### Proper Auth0 Password Authentication Implementation
- **Password Grant**: Implemented proper Auth0 password grant authentication using OAuth token endpoint
- **Real Authentication**: Now validates credentials against Auth0 instead of bypassing password verification
- **Error Handling**: Added specific error handling for Auth0 authentication failures (invalid_grant, too_many_attempts, access_denied)
- **User Info Retrieval**: After successful authentication, retrieves user information from Auth0's userinfo endpoint
- **Security**: Login now properly validates passwords against Auth0's authentication system
- **Configuration**: Requires Auth0 password grant to be enabled in Auth0 dashboard for production use

### Auth0 Password Grant Configuration Guide
To enable proper password authentication in production, follow these steps in your Auth0 dashboard:

1. **Enable Password Grant**:
   - Go to Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Your API Application
   - Navigate to "Advanced Settings" → "Grant Types"
   - Enable "Password" grant type
   - Save changes

2. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Go to Authentication → Database → Username-Password-Authentication
   - Ensure "Disable Sign Ups" is set to "No" (if you want to allow registration)
   - Configure password policies as needed

3. **Set Up Application Settings**:
   - Ensure your application has the correct client ID and secret
   - Verify the audience is set correctly in your environment variables
   - Test the password grant with a tool like Postman or curl

4. **Environment Variables Required**:
   ```
   AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
   AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience
   ```

5. **Testing the Implementation**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.auth0.com/oauth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "grant_type": "password",
       "username": "user@example.com",
       "password": "userpassword",
       "client_id": "your-client-id",
       "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
       "scope": "openid profile email",
       "audience": "your-api-audience"
     }'
   ```

**Note**: The password grant is disabled by default for security reasons. Only enable it if you have a specific use case that requires it, and ensure you have proper security measures in place.

### Route Protection Implementation
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented route protection using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented authentication checks
- **Protected Routes**: Added authentication protection to `/practice`, `/path`, `/species`, and `/profile` routes
- **Authentication Check**: Each protected route component checks `isLoggedIn` status using `useAuth` hook
- **Redirect Logic**: Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/login` using `useNavigate` and `useEffect`
- **Component Rendering**: Protected routes return `null` when user is not authenticated to prevent flash of content
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- **Mock Strategy**: Updated existing route tests to mock `useAuth` and `useNavigate` for proper testing
- **User Experience**: Seamless redirection ensures users can't access protected content without authentication

### Route Protection Refactoring - DRY Principle
- **Code Duplication Identified**: Route protection logic was repeated across all protected route components
- **TDD Refactoring**: Used TDD to extract repeated logic into reusable `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Component Extraction**: Created `ProtectedRoute` wrapper component that handles authentication checks and redirection
- **Simplified Route Components**: Route components now focus only on their content, wrapped in `ProtectedRoute`
- **Reduced Code**: Eliminated ~15 lines of repeated code per route component (60+ lines total)
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for authentication logic makes future changes easier
- **Test Simplification**: Individual route tests now mock `ProtectedRoute` instead of complex auth mocks
- **Reusability**: `ProtectedRoute` can be used for any future protected components

### Logger Service Implementation with Pino (NestJS Best Practices)
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented PinoLoggerService using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **NestJS Compliance**: Followed official [NestJS Logger documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/logger) patterns
- **PinoLoggerService**: Custom logger implementing NestJS `LoggerService` interface with Pino backend
- **Application-wide Integration**: Used `app.useLogger()` in `main.ts` to replace NestJS built-in logger
- **Logger Factory Pattern**: Created `createLogger()` factory function as recommended in NestJS docs
- **Dual Output**: Logs are written to both files (for persistence) and console (for development)
- **Environment Configuration**: Different log levels and formats based on NODE_ENV (development vs production)
- **Structured Logging**: Support for both simple string logging and structured context logging
- **Child Loggers**: Ability to create child loggers with default context for different services
- **File Rotation**: Logs are saved to files with daily rotation (app-YYYY-MM-DD.log format)
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for all logging methods and configurations
- **Service Integration**: Updated AuthService to use structured logging for registration and login flows
- **Proper DI**: Logger is properly injected throughout the application using NestJS dependency injection
- **Import Fix**: Fixed missing `ConfigService` import in `app.module.ts` that was causing ESM loader errors
- **Pretty Console Output**: Added `pino-pretty` for readable console output in development while keeping JSON format for log files
- **Comprehensive Logging Audit**: Ensured all backend services use the custom logger service instead of direct console statements

### Species API Implementation with TDD
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented species list and detail endpoints using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **Database Entities**: Created `SpeciesEntity` and `SpeciesCommonNameEntity` with proper TypeORM decorators and relationships
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented `SpeciesRepository` with batch querying capabilities for performance optimization
- **Service Layer**: Created `SpeciesService` with structured logging and error handling for species operations
- **Controller Layer**: Implemented `SpeciesController` with proper API response formatting and error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Used batch queries (`findCommonNamesBySpeciesIds`) instead of individual queries for better performance
- **Type Safety**: Used proper TypeScript types with `SpeciesWithCommonName` extending base `Species` type
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage for both success and error scenarios
- **Refactoring**: Optimized service layer to batch common name queries and simplified controller return types
- **Module Integration**: Properly integrated new entities and services into the main `AppModule`

### Language Selector Implementation with TDD
- **TDD Approach**: Implemented language selector using Test-Driven Development - wrote failing tests first, then implemented functionality
- **Language Context**: Created `LanguageProvider` context to manage language state across the application with localStorage persistence
- **Component Refactoring**: Refactored `LanguageSelector` component to use language context instead of managing its own state
- **i18n Integration**: Updated i18n configuration to use proper language codes ('es-AR', 'en-US') instead of generic ('es', 'en')
- **API Integration**: Species service already supported language parameters - integrated with language context for automatic language switching
- **Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end language switching behavior
- **Accessibility**: Language selector includes proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid language values with fallback to default language
- **State Management**: Language choice persists across page reloads and component re-renders
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for language values with TypeScript union types ('es-AR' | 'en-US')
- **Test Organization**: Separate test files for component, context, service, and integration testing
- **Mock Strategy**: Proper mocking of localStorage and fetch for reliable test execution
- **User Experience**: Seamless language switching that updates both UI translations and API calls
